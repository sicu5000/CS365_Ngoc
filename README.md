# Autonomous Agent Navigation Project 🚀

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project implements an autonomous agent navigation system in a 2D grid environment with fixed and moving obstacles. The agent is trained to move from a start point to a goal point using a combination of **Behavioral Cloning (BC)** and **DAgger** algorithms, both of which are trained on expert paths generated by the **Hybrid A\*** pathfinding algorithm. The main goal is to have the agent predict optimal next steps without recalculating the entire path during navigation.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **Data Generation**: `create_dataset.py` generates start and goal points and computes expert paths with Hybrid A\*. These paths are saved as `(Start_X, Start_Y, Current_X, Current_Y) → (Next_X, Next_Y)` in `dataset.csv`.

2. **Interactive Setup**: `grid_gui.py` allows you to manually design maps and obstacles for simulation.

3. **Model Training**:

   * **Behavioral Cloning**: Learns directly from A\* paths to imitate its movements.
   * **DAgger**: Improves on Behavioral Cloning by retraining on the agent's own mistakes.

4. **Simulation**: `main.py` runs the trained model or A\* in a visual simulation, showing the agent's navigation through the grid.

## 📊 **Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned**

* **Hybrid A\*** provides optimal paths but is computationally heavy in real-time.
* **Behavioral Cloning** is fast but can suffer from errors when diverging from expert paths.
* **DAgger** improves robustness by learning from its own mistakes.
* **Data preprocessing** (normalization) significantly improves model performance.
* Using **real-time simulation** helps understand model strengths and weaknesses visually.
